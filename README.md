# Feature selection in requirements engineering

This repository contains scripts to replicate the method used in the manuscript. Unfortunately, due to NDAs, the authors are not allowed to release data as-is. However, in the plots and data description section one can see the input given to the model development steps. Hence, it is easy to simulate data in order to verify our approach.

[docs/](https://github.com/torkar/feature-selection-RBS/tree/master/docs) contains the replication package. The easiest way to access this is to simply clone this repository and use `RStudio` to load the file `Feature Selection RBS.Rproj` (word of warning, we use `Stan`, `brms` etc. so there's a lot to install).

[plots/](https://github.com/torkar/feature-selection-RBS/tree/master/plots) contains plots as found in the manuscript (in addition to some that have not been included in order to save space).

Finally, one can always look at the replication package directly [online](https://torkar.github.io/feature-selection-RBS/).
